# Learning Machine Learning
In this repository, I embark on the journey of understanding machine learning through code, from the basic algorithms to the more advanced topics.

I studied the algorithms in the following order:
* linear regression
* polynomial regression
* logistic regression
* softmax regression
* naive bayes
* gaussian naive bayes
* support vector machine
* k-nearest neighbors
